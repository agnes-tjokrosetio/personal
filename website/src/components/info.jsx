      "Traditional budgeting apps often fail to engage younger users, making financial management feel like a chore rather than an empowering tool. As part of a team, we saw a gap in the market for a budgeting app that integrates financial education, AI-driven insights, and interactive elements that resonate with Gen Z. Our goal was to create a platform that not only helps users save but also educates them about responsible financial decision-making in addition to being entertaining to increase retention rates. It utilises an AI Chatbot to provide real-time financial insights, spending analysis, and personalised recommendations; simulates risk-taking scenarios to teach users about probability, financial consequences, and responsible decision-making; encourages goal-setting with progress tracking and incentives for consistent saving; and enables users to allocate funds toward causes they care about, reinforcing financial planning with social impact.",

As a VIP Student, I was able to work as a Software Engineer as part of the Software Team. My main responsibilities involved designing and refining the patient app accompanying the total artificial heart and building the website and desktop app for clinician access. I was also collaborating with other teams (mainly the Systems team) in working to integrate sensors and Bluetooth into the app backend.",
