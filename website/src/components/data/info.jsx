As part of a team, we saw a gap in the market for a budgeting app that integrates financial education, AI-driven insights, and interactive elements that resonate with Gen Z. Our goal was to create a platform that not only helps users save but also educates them about responsible financial decision-making in addition to being entertaining to increase retention rates. It utilises an AI Chatbot to provide real-time financial insights, spending analysis, and personalised recommendations; simulates risk-taking scenarios to teach users about probability, financial consequences, and responsible decision-making; encourages goal-setting with progress tracking and incentives for consistent saving; and enables users to allocate funds toward causes they care about, reinforcing financial planning with social impact.",
